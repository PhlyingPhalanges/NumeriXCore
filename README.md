# NumeriXCore
High-Performance Numerical Analysis Library for Web Applications

This library was developed with insights gained from various textbooks and academic resources on numerical analysis. Key references that informed the principles and methods applied in this library include:

- SÃ¼li, E., & Mayers, D. F. (2003). An Introduction to Numerical Analysis. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
- Another APA citation here once I find one

These resources provided a solid foundation in numerical methods, which was instrumental in the development of NumeriXCore.
